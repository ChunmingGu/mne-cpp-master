    <Description>MNE Scan is an open-source and cross platform application built with tools provided by the MNE-CPP framework. Currently, it is in active clinical use at the Boston Childrenâ€™s Hospital. With its acquisition and algorithmic plugin architecture it is the ideal tool for acquiring and processing data of the novel babyMEG system in real-time. Next to the babyMEG MNE-X is also able to connect to the Neuromag VectorView system and EEG amplifiers (TMSI Refa, eegosports, gtec) and provide real-time MEG/EEG data streams.</Description>
